The goal of MyProject is to develop a corporate-scale application that showcases the power of C# and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). As a developer, this project will provide me with valuable experience in OOP design, layered architecture, and enterprise-level software development.

The project consists of the following layers: Business, ConsoleUI, DataAccess, and Entities. This layered architecture ensures that the project is modular, flexible, and sustainable.

I aim to leverage C# and OOP principles to build a robust and scalable application. Through this project, I will gain practical knowledge in areas such as OOP design, layered architecture, and best practices for enterprise software development.
